# TODO - Work in Progress

This repository contains guidelines for commit messages, branching strategies, and other development practices, but it's still a work in progress. Some sections may not be fully fleshed out yet, and updates or improvements are ongoing.

## Whatâ€™s Still To Do:

- [ ] Add more detailed examples for specific branching strategies.
- [ ] Expand on automated tools for enforcing commit message standards.
- [ ] Include additional resources for CI/CD integration.
- [ ] Create a section on testing and code review best practices.
- [ ] Clarify versioning practices and automate version bumping guidelines.
- [ ] Review and refine the branching strategy examples for larger teams.

If you see something missing or think of ways to improve this guide, feel free to contribute or suggest changes!

Thank you for your understanding and contributions.
