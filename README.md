This repository contains my personal approach and recommendations for best practices in software development, including commit message standards, branching strategies, and related workflows. These are practices I’ve found to be effective over time and reflect how I prefer to organize code and collaborate with teams.

While these guidelines are designed to improve consistency and clarity within projects, I recognize that different teams and individuals may have their own approaches. The ideas shared here are meant to serve as a starting point or a reference, but they are by no means the only way to do things. I encourage you to adapt them as necessary to fit the unique needs and preferences of your own projects and teams.

Feel free to contribute suggestions or improvements if you think there’s a better way to approach any of the topics. This is a continuously evolving process, and I believe that sharing ideas helps everyone grow.
